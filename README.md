# Akkounts

### Playing with Akka.NET:

* Transactions and accounts are randomly generated by a background .net core worker service.
* Transactions (debit/credit) of each account will be handled by an Akka.NET Actor.
* These transactions are sent to the customer through SignalR.
* In the client browser, concurrent events are received and enqueued through Bacon.js
* Each bubble represents an Akka Actor handling an account.
* The bubble size corresponds to the account balance.
* When an actor timeout expires, the color of correspondent bubble will turn gray.
